## Loops

```
for (i in 1..3) {println(i)}
```

Hereâ€™s a more generic example:

`for (item in collection) println(item)`

The second type of loop is the while loop,

```
var x = 10while (x > 0) {x--}
```

There is a variation of while known as do-while.

```
var x = 10do {
x--} while (x > 0)
```

## Functions

```
fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int {return if (a > b) a else b}
```
